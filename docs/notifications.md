### Create an alert

To create an alert, navigate to the notifications page through the profile dropdown on the right side of the top navigation bar. Select the attribute, node, bound, and value that you would like to be notified for. 

You may select among the following attributes:
* Mean Heat Ratio
* Mean Outside Temperature
* Mean Soil Moisture.

When selecting a bound, you may choose to be notified with the selected attribute is equal to, below, or above the target value. Then, click `Add` to add the alert. Now, you will receive a notification when that node's target attribute reaches the specified criteria.
